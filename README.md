## Description

Social Platform is a full-stack social media content publishing scheduler built with Next.js and MongoDB. It is currently a work in progress, intended for personal use. The goal is to develop a tool that streamlines the scheduling and management of social media posts. Depending on its success and usability, I may consider turning it into a SaaS product in the future.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
